# WEX Component Rules (NORMATIVE)

This document is BINDING for all component development in this repository.
AI assistants (including Cursor) and human contributors MUST follow these rules.

---

## CURSOR AI GOVERNANCE (MANDATORY)

### Required Prompt Prefix

All Cursor sessions working in this repository MUST begin with:

> "Follow WEX_COMPONENT_RULES.md as a hard constraint. Reject changes that violate it."

### Constraint Verification

Before proposing any component change, Cursor MUST:
1. Read this file
2. Verify the proposed change against all rules below
3. Reject or flag any violation before proceeding

### Violations

If a proposed change violates these rules, Cursor MUST:
1. Identify the specific rule being violated
2. Explain why the change violates it
3. Propose a compliant alternative

---

## 1. Token Usage (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 1.1 No Raw Colors

- NEVER use hex values, rgb(), or hsl() with literal values
- ALWAYS use Tailwind utilities that resolve to CSS variables
- ALLOWED: `bg-primary`, `text-foreground`, `border-input`
- FORBIDDEN: `bg-blue-500`, `text-[#003366]`, `border-gray-300`

### 1.2 No Arbitrary Value Wrappers for Colors

- NEVER use `bg-[hsl(var(--wex-*))]` or similar arbitrary value patterns
- ALWAYS use named Tailwind utilities (e.g., `hover:bg-primary-hover`)
- If a state color is missing from Tailwind config, ADD IT to the config
- Do NOT work around missing utilities with arbitrary values

**Whitelisted Direct WEX Variable Access:**

The following `--wex-*` variables MAY be accessed directly in component classes (not via arbitrary wrappers):
- `--wex-focus-ring-width` (for focus ring sizing)
- `--wex-focus-ring-offset` (for focus ring offset)
- `--wex-min-target` (for minimum target sizing)

These are non-color values where Tailwind arbitrary value syntax is acceptable:

```
focus-visible:ring-[length:var(--wex-focus-ring-width)]
```

### 1.3 No Raw Sizing for Interactive Elements

- ALWAYS use `min-h-target min-w-target` for buttons and interactive controls
- This ensures 44x44px minimum touch target per WCAG 2.5.5

### 1.4 Focus States Required

- ALL interactive components MUST have visible focus-visible states
- Use the standard pattern:

```
focus-visible:outline-none
focus-visible:ring-[length:var(--wex-focus-ring-width)]
focus-visible:ring-ring
focus-visible:ring-offset-[length:var(--wex-focus-ring-offset)]
focus-visible:ring-offset-background
```

---

## 2. Component Architecture (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 2.1 CVA Required for Variants

- ALL components with variants MUST use class-variance-authority
- Variant names must be semantic (intent, size) not visual (blue, large)

### 2.2 asChild Pattern for Polymorphism

- Use @radix-ui/react-slot for components needing polymorphism
- NEVER use `as` prop pattern

### 2.3 ForwardRef Required

- ALL components MUST use React.forwardRef
- displayName MUST be set

---

## 3. File Organization (REQUIRED)

### 3.1 Component Location

- shadcn-style components: `src/components/ui/`
- WEX-specific components: `src/components/ui/wex-*.tsx`

### 3.2 Style Files (Authorship Policy)

| File | Authorship | Notes |
|------|------------|-------|
| `src/styles/wex.tokens.css` | **GENERATED** (future) | Currently hand-authored; will become Style Dictionary output |
| `src/styles/wex.shadcn-bridge.css` | **HAND-AUTHORED** | Semantic mapping decisions require human intent |

### 3.3 Generation Markers

When Style Dictionary is introduced, generated files will include:

```css
/* AUTO-GENERATED by Style Dictionary - DO NOT EDIT */
```

Files with this header MUST NOT be manually edited.

---

## 4. Theme Ownership

### 4.1 Current State

- Token files are manually authored
- Changes require updating both light and dark values in `wex.tokens.css`

### 4.2 Future State (Style Dictionary)

- `src/styles/wex.tokens.css` will become a GENERATED file
- Source of truth will be `tokens/*.json`
- Manual edits to generated files will be overwritten

### 4.3 Bridge File Remains Manual

- `wex.shadcn-bridge.css` will NOT be generated
- Semantic mappings (which WEX token maps to which shadcn slot) require design decisions
- This file must be maintained by humans

---

## 5. Extension Points (ALLOWED)

### 5.1 New Components

- May create new components following patterns above
- Must use existing tokens; new tokens require design approval

### 5.2 New Variants

- May add variants to existing components
- Must use CVA pattern
- Must use existing color tokens

### 5.3 New State Colors

If a component needs a new state (e.g., `--accent-hover`):

1. Add the token to `wex.tokens.css` (light and dark)
2. Add the bridge variable to `wex.shadcn-bridge.css`
3. Add the Tailwind color extension to `tailwind.config.ts`
4. Use the named utility in the component

- NEVER use arbitrary values as a workaround

### 5.4 FORBIDDEN Extensions

- New color tokens without design approval
- Raw color values anywhere
- Arbitrary value wrappers for colors
- Components without focus states
- Components without minimum target sizes

---

## 6. Verification Checklist

Before any PR or commit, verify:

- [ ] No raw hex/rgb/hsl values in component files
- [ ] No `bg-[hsl(var(--wex-*))]` patterns (except whitelisted non-color uses)
- [ ] All interactive elements have `min-h-target min-w-target`
- [ ] All interactive elements have focus-visible ring pattern
- [ ] All variant components use CVA
- [ ] All components use forwardRef with displayName
- [ ] Any new state colors follow the extension process (Section 5.3)

---

## 7. Changelog Requirements (MANDATORY)

Any Cursor execution or implementation run that changes code MUST include a Changelog update.

### 7.1 Required Fields

Each changelog entry MUST include:
- **Date**: When the change was made
- **Summary**: Brief description of what changed
- **Pages/Components Affected**: List of files or features touched
- **Breaking Changes**: If any, explicitly noted
- **Accessibility Signal Changes**: If a11y tests were affected, note here

### 7.2 Update Location

Update `src/docs/pages/ChangelogPage.tsx` by adding a new `ChangelogEntry` at the top of the entries list.

### 7.3 Version Numbering

- Patch (0.0.X): Bug fixes, minor styling adjustments
- Minor (0.X.0): New features, new components, significant improvements
- Major (X.0.0): Breaking changes, major refactors
